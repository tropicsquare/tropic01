## Reading Your Chip Information

### What is Chip ID?

Your chip contains identifying information burned in during manufacturing. This includes:
- Part number (which variant you have)
- Provisioning data (proves it's genuine)
- Package type (QFN32)
- Silicon revision
- Unique serial number

Reading this before you start helps verify you have the right chip and provides a reference point for future updates.

### Example Output
```
P/N: TR01-C2P-T310
Prov info: [provisioning data]
Package: QFN32
```

### How to Read Your Chip ID

1. Choose your platform:
   - [STM32 examples](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic-stm32)
   - [Linux examples](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic-linux)
   - [General SDK](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic)

2. Reading chip ID is the first step in each platform tutorial.

3. Save this output for future reference before updating firmware.
