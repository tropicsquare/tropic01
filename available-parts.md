## Important: Software-defined product

TROPIC01 is a software-defined product. The same silicon behaves differently based on which firmware version is loaded.

A chip's part number tells you what firmware was loaded at manufacturing. If you update the firmware, the chip's behavior changes to match the new firmware version.

**Example:** A TR01-C2P-T301 chip (firmware 1.0.0) updated to firmware 2.0.0 would behave like TR01-C2P-T310.
