### Disclaimer TROPIC01 Pre-Production samples

TROPIC01 samples available on TS13, TS14, TS15 and Mikroe click boards are pre-production batch which
should be used for design and integration evaluation only. This early batch distributed from February 2025
went through expedited packaging and provisioning process which deviates from the actual production chips
shipped later in 2025. Non-exhaustive list of deviations from the production chip specification includes:

* Devices S/N does not follow the scheme defined in [TR01_ODN_app_003 - Device Identity and PKI Application Note](TODO:Link).
* Devices P/N does not follow the scheme defined in [TR01_ODN_app_004 - Packaging and Labeling Application Note](TODO:Link), instead the device identifies as TODOPARTNUMBERFROMPAVEL.
* HW environmental sensors (such as laser detector, EM field detector) aren't activated.
* Bootloader ROM code is pre-production version (ABAB silicon revision - Bootloader version 1.0.1).
* Device key pair isn't generated by production PKI infrastructure, and device certificate list is invalid.
