# TROPIC01 secure element resource guide

# Disclaimer TROPIC01 Pre-Production  samples

TROPIC01 samples available on TS13, TS14, TS15 and Mikroe click boards are pre-production batch which should be used for design and integration evaluation only. This early batch distributed from February 2025 went through expedited packaging and provisioning process which deviates from the actual production chips which will start shipping later in 2025. Non-exhaustive list of deviations from the production chip specification includes:
 - HW environmental sensors (such as laser detector, EM field detector) aren't activated.
 - Bootloader ROM code is pre-production version.
 - Device key pair isn't generated by production PKI infrastructure and device certificate isn't signed by production PKI issuing CA.
 - Device identifiers such as chip S/N or CHIP_ID field aren't generated according to the production identification scheme.
 
All samples with package marking TROPICP2S are engineering samples.
